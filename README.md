# Polls

Single page application with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) that lets users vote through the Polls.

## How to use

npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev

## Next steps
- [ ] Use state management (i.e Redux) (didn't use any as the application is fairly small)
- [ ] Improve management/query of async calls with [redux-query](https://github.com/amplitude/redux-query)
- [ ] Ability to re-order choices when create/edit a question (API doesn't support it)
- [ ] Pagination in polls list page
- [ ] Filters and search in polls list page
