# Polls

Single page application with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) that lets users vote through the Polls.

## How to use


Download the example [or clone the repo]():

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/zeit/next.js/tar.gz/canary | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-canary/examples/with-ant-design
cd with-ant-design
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```


## Next steps
- [ ] Use state management (i.e Redux) (didn't use any as the application is fairly small)
- [ ] ability to re-order choices (API doesn't support it)
- [ ] Pagination in polls list page
- [ ] Filters and search in polls list page
